\begin_layout Standard

The manuscript reported by Bera et al used Bayesian inference to elucidate
 the optical trap stiffness and the diffusion coefficient of particles within
 the trap.
 The paper presents two Bayesian methods, which do not require Monte Carlo
 sampling, are extremely fast, exact and can serve as an useful “null hypothesis
” when comparing between different models for the data.
 At the end, the manuscript gives some perspective to present Bayesian methods
 for more complex models and provide a fully Bayesian procedure.
 Generally, this paper is well organized and written.
 The manuscript has a certain technical depth and strong logic, but the
 layout of the paper is not good.
 I recommend a major revision.

There are too many problems with the manuscript editing.
 It is very difficult to review this manuscript because the figures and
 tables are disordered.
 In the second paragraph of the results and discussion section, it would
 be better to replace Figure.

 We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer to interchange the two figures
 in the results section, but we have retained the present order as Figure.
 (2) represents the results of an empirical statistical analysis - plotting
 of data, constructing histograms, fitting to known forms - which would
 be logically prior to a Bayesian analysis, which goes beyond the empirical
 analysis by confronting the data with a theoretical model.

The three parameters at hand are: (a) stiffness 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of the harmonic potential, (b) the friction 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the particle and the (c) the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 These parameter do not vary independently and are related by Eq.
 (1) and thus only two of them can be chosen independently.
 We also use the Einstein relation 
\begin_inset Formula $D=k_{B}T\gamma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and then choose the mean regression rate and the volatility as independent
 parameters.

The manuscript discusses some limitations of this method.
 For example, “the error bars of the Bayesian estimate for the diffusion
 coefficient, which are higher than that for the k measurement, chiefly
 reflect the systematic errors in our experimental apparatus that may arise
 due to slow drifts of the laser power……”It would be better to do some experimen
ts to explain these problems.

We have performed a whole series of measurements to check for systematic
 errors in our experiments.
 This has been done in two ways: a) by comparing the mean and standard deviation
 of measured trapping parameters over 3 sets of independent time series
 data collected at low and high trapping laser powers for the same particle
 (diameter 3 microns), and b) by comparing the trapping parameters measured
 on time series data of different length obtained at the same laser power
 for the same particle.
 The results are shown in Tables III(a) and (b).
 It is clear that systematics due to coupling with low frequency ambient
 noise occurs for low stiffness traps, while that due to slow drifts in
 experimental conditions occur at time scales longer than 20s.
 A detailed discussion has now been given in pages 6 and 7 of the revision.

Statements were made without giving supporting data.
 For example, “Thus, we conclude that the Bayesian can be used for accurate
 viscometry using only the discretely observed sample paths of a trapped
 Brownian particle.” No detailed explanation was given when obtained the
 conclusion.

We perform our experiments on an optical table with active vibration isolation
 so that there is no coupling with ambient vibrations.
 Due to the large table mass and the presence of active dampers, vibrations
 from the table itself are at much higher frequencies than our region of
 interest.
 We also take care not to place vibrating objects such as power supplies,
 etc on the table.
 This discussion has been included in page 7 of the revision.

The detection signal amplitude for Brownian motion data for 3 microns diameter
 spheres in water is around 1.5 V/m and the noise floor is around 5 mV, which
 implies that we have a sensitivity of around 7 nm (considering signal/noise=2)
 for this case.
 However, since scattering from spheres depends on diameter (generally increasin
g with diameter) as well as the refractive index of the ambient medium,
 this value changes when we change spheres or the medium.
 Typically, the particle localization is within 2-7 nm in our experiments.
 This discussion has been included in page 5 of the revision.

The authors applied two Bayesian methods to the analysis of the Brownian
 motion of a colloid particle confined in an optical trap.
 The trap stiffness and diffusion coefficient can be estimated and compared
 with the best fit to PSD and Stokes-Einstein relation.
 The validity of the methods were then appropriately checked.
 The current Bayesian methods do not require Monte Carlo sampling and are
 very accurate and fast.
 And I personally appreciate the authors’ comments on Bayesian analysis
 in the conclusion part.
 They informed the readers of the great potential of the Bayesian methods
 in soft matter study, which have not been fully explored yet.
 I think this is a rather well-written paper, for the clearly presented
 theoretical and experimental procedures and adequate illustrations.
 I recommend the acceptance.

We thank the reviewer for raising this important point.
 Bayesian methods can indeed be used to study this important case as well.
 The analysis will be considerably more involved, as there will be a coupling
 of position and orientation, involving the solution of the 6 coupled stochastic
 differential equations (or, a Fokker-Planck equation in 6 variables).
 As analytical solutions are generally not known for arbitrary times, we
 will either have to resort to short time expansions when experimental data
 is collected sufficiently rapidly compared to the typical relaxation times,
 or, fall back on Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the general case.
 We now add this remark in the discussion.
