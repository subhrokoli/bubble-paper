Dear Dr. Cao

Thank you for supervising the review process in a prompt and efficient manner. It is gratifying to observe that both reviewers have positive comments about the science we have reported in the manuscript and feel that the manuscript is worth publication in Scientific Reports. While Reviewer 2 has accepted the manuscript with minor comments, Reviewer 1 has raised some interesting issues - each of which we have addressed. We have also incorporated most of his/her suggestions in the revised manuscript so that there has been a marked improvement in the overall quality of the manuscript, for which we would like to thank him/her. 

Please find a point by point rebuttal of the reviewer comments accompanied by a revised manuscript. All changes in manuscript text are highlighted in blue. 

We hope that the manuscript would now be accepted in Scientific Reports without further delay.

Best.
