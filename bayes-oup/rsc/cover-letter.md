Dear Editor

In our manuscript titled "Fast Bayesian inference of optical trap stiffness and particle diffusion", submitted to Soft Matter, we have derived an exact Bayesian method for the estimation of the physical parameters governing the dynamics of an optically trapped Brownian particle. The first of these, the trap stiffness, is necessary for calibration of an optical trap before it can be used for force measurements. The second, the diffusion coefficient of the particle, can either be used, via the Stokes-Einstein relation, to estimate the radius of the particle, if the fluid viscosity is known, or, the fluid viscosity, if the particle radius is known. These uses are ubiquitous in the fields of colloids, polymers, and membranes. We have proceeded to use our method to experimentally measure the trap stiffness experienced by a polystyrene microsphere trapped in optical tweezers with varying intensities of the trapping laser. Further, we have used the trapped microsphere as a probe to determine the viscosity of solutions made up of different proportions of water and glycerol which we have validated with viscosity measurements of the same solutions using a commercial rheometer. 

The principle difference between our contribution, and a previous work on Bayesian inference in optical traps [Optics Express, 2013, 21, 31578â€“31590], is that our method does not require any intermediate numerical steps, like numerical minimization, or Monte Carlo sampling. We obtain exact relations for the most probable values of the parameters, which are simple functions of the time series of positions of the particle. It turns out, also, that the functions are the sufficient statistics of the problem, in the sense that they contain the entire information relevant to the estimation problem. In contrast to the above previous method, which required Monte Carlo sampling and could therefore process tens of thousands of data points in tens of seconds, our method processes millions of data points in under milliseconds. Thus, it can be used for very fast and accurate calibration or viscometry in nanofluidic contexts. 

Our work is also of direct interest in optical tweezers, which has already emerged as a particularly enabling technique for diverse studies in soft matter. We specifically compare the Bayesian methods to the commonly used techniques of fitting time and frequency domain autocorrelation data of the Brownian motion of trapped particles, and point out the advantages of the former. 

A secondary purpose of the work is to demonstrate to the readership of Soft Matter the power and elegance of Bayesian methods for the kinds of parameter estimation problems that appear routinely in soft matter problems. While the astrophysics and particle physics communities have widely adopted Bayesian methods, their use in soft matter is still sparse. We hope that our paper can serve to alert this community to the power of Bayesian methods and make a small contribution to their adoption and use. 

Given that the paper combines both theory and experiment, we have suggested three referees each from the Bayesian inference and optical trapping communities, some of whom we hope will be approached for peer review.
