\begin_layout Abstract
Bayesian inference provides a principled way of estimating the parameters
 of a stochastic process that is observed discretely in time.
 The overdamped Brownian motion of a particle confined in an optical trap
 is generally modelled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and can be observed
 directly in experiment.
 Here we present Bayesian methods for inferring the parameters of this process,
 the trap stiffness and the particle diffusion coefficient, that use exact
 likelihoods and sufficient statistics to arrive at simple expressions for
 the maximum a posteriori estimates.
 This obviates the need for Monte Carlo sampling and yields methods that
 are both fast and accurate.
 We apply these to experimental data and demonstrate their advantage over
 commonly used non-Bayesian fitting methods.

Since the seminal contributions of Rayleigh, Einstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin

, stochastic processes have been used to model physical phenomena in which
 fluctuations play an essential role.
 Examples include the Brownian motion of a particle, the fluctuation of
 current in a resistor, and the radioactive decay of subatomic particles

 A central problem is to infer the parameters of the process from partially
 observed sample paths, for instance, the diffusion constant from a time
 series of positions, or the resistance from a time series of current measuremen
ts, and so on.
 Bayesian inference provides a principled solution to this inverse problem

The motion of a Brownian particle harmonically trapped in optical tweezers

 by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process

 The stiffness 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of the harmonic potential, the friction 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the particle, and the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

 of the fluid are the three parameters of the stochastic dynamics.
 For spherical particles Stokes' law 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=6\pi\eta a$

 relates the friction to the particle radius 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and the fluid viscosity 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 diffusion coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $D$

 to the temperature and friction through 
\begin_inset Formula $D=k_{B}T\gamma^{-1}$

 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

\begin_layout Standard
Reliable estimation of the stiffness is a necessary first step in using
 tweezers for force measurements.
 An estimation of the friction, for a particle of known size, provides an
 indirect measure of the viscosity of the medium.
 This microscopic method of viscometry is of great utility when sample volumes
 are in the nanoliter range and conventional viscometric methods cannot
 be used.
 Conversely, an estimate of the friction in a fluid of known viscosity provides
 a method for estimating the particle size.
 In both these cases, an estimate of the diffusion coefficient provides,
 by virtue of the Einstein relation, identical information.

Extant protocols for estimating these parameters from discrete observations

 categories.
 In the fluctuational methods, the fluctuating position of the particle
 is recorded and the known forms of the static and dynamic correlation functions
 are fitted to the data.
 In response methods, external perturbations are applied to the particle
 and the known forms of the average response is fitted to the data.
 Considerable care is needed in these fitting procedures to obtain reliable
 estimates

In recent work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Bayesian inference has been applied to the optical tweezer parameter estimatio
n problem.
 The posterior probability distribution of the stiffness and diffusion coefficie
nt is estimated for a time series of positions, making it a method of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fluctuation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 category.
 Monte Carlo sampling is needed to compute the posterior distribution and
 estimation from a time series of 
\begin_inset Formula $10,000$
\end_inset

 points requires few tens of seconds.
 The advantages of the Bayesian method over conventional calibration methods
 have been discussed at length in this work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we present two Bayesian methods, of the fluctuational category,
 which do not require Monte Carlo sampling and, consequently, are extremely
 fast.
 For example, they estimate the trap stiffness and diffusion coefficient
 from time series containing a million points in less than a millisecond.
 The first method extracts information exploiting the Markov property of
 the sample path and jointly estimates the mean regression rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k/\gamma$
\end_inset

 and the diffusion coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 The second method extracts information from the equal-time fluctuations
 of the position, which, in equilibrium, cannot depend on the friction coefficie
nt, and is, then, a function of the stiffness 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 alone.
 In essence, this is a recasting of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equipartition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method in the language of Bayesian inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first method, in addition to inheriting the generic advantages of Bayesian
 inference that have already been pointed out in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "richly2013calibrating"

\end_inset

, has several specific advantages.
 First, it uses the exact expression for the likelihood, which is valid
 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

, the interval at which the position is observed.
 Therefore, it works reliably with data acquired at low frequencies.
 Second, the exact likelihood is expressed in terms of four sufficient statistic
s, which are quadratic functions of the positions.
 Their use greatly reduces the computation needed to evaluate the posterior
 distribution, as four numbers, rather than a large time series now represents
 the entire information relevant to inference.
 Finally, we are able to obtain exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates
 of the mean regression and diffusion coefficients, and their error bars,
 in terms of the four sufficient statistics.
 This obviates the need for the Monte Carlo sampling or numerical minimization
 steps usually required in Bayesian inference.
 Bayesian credible regions are easily calculated from the analytically obtained
 error bars.
 The second method is different from the conventional equipartition method
 in that it provides a Bayesian error bar, representing a Bayesian credible
 interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The combined use of exact likelihoods, sufficient statistics and analytical
 MAP estimates yields both speed and accuracy in parameter estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We apply both methods to experimental data and obtain MAP estimates and
 error bars that are in excellent agreement with each other.
 These estimates are found to be in good agreement with the commonly used
 power spectral density (PSD) calibration method

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 In the next section we recall several key properties of the sample paths
 and distributions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
 We, then, present the Bayesian methods and describe the experimental setup.
 The Bayesian procedures is then applied to the experimental data.
 We conclude with a discussion of future directions in the application of
 Bayesian inference to optical tweezer experiments and advocate its use
 as a complement to standard non-Bayesian methods.

The Langevin equation for a Brownian particle confined in a potential

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_inset

 The latter follows by comparing the Langevin and Ito forms of the path
 equation and recalling the Einstein relation 
\begin_inset Formula $D=k_{B}T\gamma^{-1}$

 In problems involving Brownian motion, it is convenient to work with the
 diffusion coefficient, rather than the volatility.

A second Bayesian procedure for directly estimating the trap stiffness results
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 is interpreted not as a time series but as an exchangeable sequence, or,
 in physical terms, as repeated independent observations of the stationary
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(x)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jaynes2003probability"

\end_inset

.
 In that case, the posterior probability, assuming an informative prior
 that constrains 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to positive values, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln P(k|X)=\frac{N}{2}\ln\frac{k}{2\pi k_{B}T}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{k}{k_{B}T}\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_{n}^{2}\label{eq:k-posterior}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The MAP estimate and its error bar follow straightforwardly from the posterior
 distribution as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{k^{\star}}{k_{B}T}=\frac{N}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_{n}^{2}},\quad\sigma_{k}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\frac{k^{\star}}{k_{B}T}\label{eq:k-map}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and, not unexpectedly, the standard error decreases as the number of observation
s increases.
 This procedure is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 and is equivalent to the equipartition method when the Heaviside prior
 is used for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

The posterior probabilities in both methods can be written in terms of four

 The

 Their use reduces computational expense greatly, as only four numbers,
 rather than the entire time series, is needed for evaluating the posterior

 The number of observations are in the tens of thousands in time series
 we study here and the posterior is dominated by the likelihoood rather
 than the prior.
 The prior, then, has an insignificant contribution to the posterior.

We note that the error bars obtained in both Bayes I and Bayes II refer
 to Bayesian credible intervals, which are relevant to the uncertainty in
 the parameter estimates, given the data set

 In contrast, conventional error bars refer to frequentist confidence intervals,
 which are relevant to the outcomes of hypothetical repetitions of measurement.
 In general, Bayesian credible intervals and frequentist confidence intervals
 are not identical and should

A comparison of the estimates for the trap stiffness obtained from these
 independent procedures provides a check on the validity of the Ornstein-Uhlenbe

 Any significant disagreement between the estimates from the two methods
 signals a breakdown of the applicability of the model and the assumptions
 implicit in it: overdamped dynamics, constant friction, harmonicity of
 the potential, and thermal equilibrium.

 using a standard optical tweezers setup that is described in detail in

 Here we provide a brief overview.
 The optical tweezers system is constructed around a Zeiss inverted microscope
 (

Axiovert.A1

) with a 
\begin_inset Formula $100x$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $1.4$

\end_inset

 nm from a semiconductor laser (
\emph on
Lasever
\emph default
, maximum power 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

mW) into the sample.
 The back aperture of the objective is slightly overfilled to maximize the
 trapping intensity.
 The sample consists of a dilute suspension (volume fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.01$
\end_inset

) of polystyrene spheres of diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $3\mu$
\end_inset

m in 10% NaCl-water solution, around 
\begin_inset Formula $20\mu l$
\end_inset

 of which is pipetted on a standard glass cover slip.
 The total power available at the trapping plane is around 15 mW.
 A single particle is trapped at an axial distance greater than several
 times its radius to avoid any wall-effects in the effective drag force
 due to the water, and it's motion is observed by back-focal plane interferometr
y using the back-scattered intensity of a detection laser at 
\begin_inset Formula $671$
\end_inset

 nm that co-propagates with the trapping laser.
 The detection laser power is maintained at much lower levels than that
 required to trap a particle.
 The back-scattered signal from the trapped particle is measured using a
 balanced detection scheme, schematically illustrated in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:balanced-detection"

\end_inset

.
 The back-scattered light beam is incident on an edge mirror which divides
 it equally into two halves that are focused using two lenses of equal focal
 length on photodiodes PD1 and PD2 (
\emph on
Thorlabs
\emph default
 PDA100A-EC Si-photodiodes of bandwidth 2.4 MHz).
 The voltage outputs 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, of PD1 and PD2 respectively, are then combined as 
\begin_inset Formula $(A-B)/(A+B)$
\end_inset

 to give the normalized value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 coordinate of motion at any instant of time.
 The advantage of such balanced detection is that the intensity fluctuations
 of the laser are present in both beams simultaneously and are thus canceled
 out when the difference is taken.
 Note that the direction of the edge mirror decides whether the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 coordinate of motion is being measured.
 The mirror is rotated by 
\begin_inset Formula $90$
\end_inset

 degrees to select between the coordinates.
 The fast response of the photodiodes, with a rise time of 50ns at highest
 gain, ensures that spurious correlations are kept to a minimum and the
 data filtering necessary with slower commercial quadrant photodetectors
 is avoided entirely.

m diameter spheres in water is around 1.5 V/

 of around 7 nm (considering signal/noise=2) for this case.
 However, since scattering from spheres depends on diameter (generally increasin
g with diameter) as well as the refractive index of the ambient medium,
 this value changes when we change spheres or the medium.
 Typically, the particle localization is within 2-7 nm in our experiments.
 
\color inherit
For the viscosity measurement, we add glycerol to water in fixed proportions
 to create 5 samples of different viscosity.
 The viscosity of each sample is then measured by a commercial rheometer
 (Brookfield DB3TLVCJ0) to match with the experimental results.

The voltage-distance calibration is performed every time we change the particle

We note that the measured data is a result of a transformation by the detection
 apparatus of the physical sample paths.
 The Bayesian modeling of the detection apparatus and the transformations
 it induces on the physical sample paths is not pursued here.
 Therefore, we have a problem of pure estimation and there is no attempt
 to compare between alternative models of the data generation process.

We now present our results.
 In Figure.
 (

LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:discrete-sample-path"

\end_inset

) we show a typical sample path of one component of motion in the plane
 of the trap, together with its histogram, autocorrelation function and
 spectral density.
 The histogram shows that the distribution of positions is stationary and
 very well-approximated by a Gaussian.
 The variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle x^{2}\rangle$
\end_inset

 is used in the conventional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equipartition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method to estimate the spring constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, while the fitting of the autocorrelation to the exponential in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:autocorr"

\end_inset

) or of the spectral density to the Lorentzian in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:spectral-density"

\end_inset

) is used to estimate the spring constant when the friction constant is
 given.
 For estimation of the stiffness from the PSD, we employ the procedures
 suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, including 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

key "berg2004power"

\end_inset

.
 However, there exist issues in estimating stiffness from both the equipartition
 method - where the presence of any additive noise leads to an increase
 in the variance that leads to over-estimation of the trap stiffness, and
 the PSD - where the standard systematics related to fitting can be minimized
 at best but not removed.

The results of Bayesian inference are shown in Figure.

 There is a single maximum at

\end_inset

 whose numerically computed value is in excellent agreement with the analytical
 MAP estimates of Eq.(

\end_inset

).
 In the bottom panel we show the Bayesian posterior distribution for the
 stiffness for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bayes II
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 method.
 There is remarkably good agreement between the two Bayesian estimates and
 the fit to the power spectral density as shown in Fig.

\end_inset

) and Table.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:k-versus-power"

\end_inset

).
 This consistency between three conceptually and procedurally independent
 methods is evidence for the appropriateness of the data model.
 The agreement with the spectral density method, shown in the third column
 of the table, is within 
\begin_inset Formula $2-3\%$
\end_inset

 in all cases, other than the first case where the inherent low stiffness
 of the trap due to low trapping power led to larger systematics due to
 the increased influence of the ambient low frequency noise, 
\color blue
as we shall discuss later
\color inherit
.
 The typical length of our time series is 
\begin_inset Formula $N\sim30000$
\end_inset

 and this gives a Bayesian error bar that is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

% of the mean.
 These are well below the systematic errors and the approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $1.5-2\%$
\end_inset

 variability of the estimates obtained from the fitting procedure.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $1\sigma$

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 Note that for inference of the absolute values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

, we have used a temperature of 300K which is the the same as the lab environmen
t temperature - this assumption being based on studies in literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "schmidt03heating"

\end_inset

where the effects of laser heating in water has shown to be well below 1K
 at the power levels we employ in the trap.
 However, the fact that the results from Bayes I and Bayes II are extremely
 close to each other demonstrates that our estimate of temperature is trustworth
y.
 
\color blue
Next, in order to determine the robustness of our experimental techniques,
 we perform experiments on two other sizes of polystyrene spheres - of diameter
 5 and 10 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

m, respectively.
 Representative values of measured stiffness and diffusion constant at a
 laser power of 43.8 mW are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is clear that the remarkable consistency in the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

 given by the Bayes I and II methods are preserved, as is the close agreement
 with the values obtained from the PSD analysis.
 Note that the stiffness values are not really related to bead size as is
 well known in literature - the dependence of

 on bead diameter being rather non-linear

Our next set of measurements are directed towards determining the extent
 of systematic errors in our measurements.
 Systematic errors in our experimental apparatus may arise due to various
 issues including slow drifts of the laser power, beam pointing of the laser,
 drifts in ambient temperature, coupling with ambient low frequency (typically
 acoustic) noise sources, and possibly other unidentified reasons.
 The coupling with ambient low frequency noise sources would manifest themselves
 at low trapping stiffness, where sudden perturbations could affect the
 Brownian motion of the bead since the restoring force is less.
 On the other hand, the affect of slow drifts of experimental parameters
 would be observed at time series data of longer length.
 Thus, we attempt to understand the effect of systematics in our experiments
 using two different approaches: a) by comparing the mean and standard deviation
 of measured trapping parameters over 3 sets of independent time series
 data collected at low and high trapping laser powers for the same particle
 (diameter 3 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m), and b) by comparing the trapping parameters measured on time series
 data of different length obtained at the same laser power for the same
 particle.
 The results are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:systematic-error"

\end_inset

(a) and (b).
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:systematic-error"

\end_inset

(a), we observe that at a low laser power of 18.5 mW, we have a standard
 deviation of around 6.5% in 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula ${\color{blue}k}$
\end_inset


\color blue
 and 4.5% in 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

, while at the higher power of 43.8 mW, the standard deviation is only around
 1.5% for both 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula ${\color{blue}k}$
\end_inset

 
\color blue
and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

.
 This demonstrates that the effect of ambient noise does increase at lower
 trapping powers.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:systematic-error"

\end_inset

(b), we show the results of measurements of 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula ${\color{blue}k}$
\end_inset

 
\color blue
and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

for time series data of different lengths for the same particle trapped
 at a laser power of 48 mW (we choose a high laser power since the coupling
 with the ambient noise is lesser in that case).
 It is clear that for time series of lengths 5, 10, and 20s, the variation
 in the mean of both 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula ${\color{blue}k}$
\end_inset

 
\color blue
and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

is only around 1.5%, but there is a large change in the mean values between
 7-24% for time series data of 40 and 60s.
 In addition, we check that the estimates of 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula ${\color{blue}k}$
\end_inset

 
\color blue
and 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

over different non-overlapping segments of up to 20s length in a 
\emph on
single 
\emph default
data set are within the Bayesian error bars for all the time series; however,
 for 40 and 60s, the mean values of different non-overlapping sets of 20s
 data differ from each other significantly.
 Thus, it is clear that systematics due to slow drifts in different experimental
 apparatus occur at time scales longer than 20s.
 Note that we perform our experiments on an optical table with active vibration
 isolation, so that there is no coupling with ambient vibrations, whereas
 vibrations from the table itself are at much higher frequencies than our
 region of interest due to the large table mass and are also damped out
 very fast by the presence of active dampers (we also take care not to place
 vibrating objects such as power supplies, etc on the table).

As mentioned earlier, we

 have checked that the estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$

over different non-overlapping segments of a

data set are within the Bayesian error bars, which 
\color blue
again 
\color inherit
confirms that the errors we observe are due to systematic shifts in the
 operating conditions of the experiment.
 The agreement in the viscosity values for that measured in the rheometer
 and by the Bayesian estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\star}$
\end_inset

is within 5% for all cases with the exception of the last, where the enhanced
 friction caused a shift in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 towards lower values, once again increasing the effects of systematics
 due to ambient low frequency noise sources.
 Also, since this value corresponded to the highest concentration of glycerol
 in the water + glycerol mixture, the effects of laser heating could have
 been more significant

, leading to a slight increase of temperature at the trap focal volume which
 we have not considered in the Bayesian estimate.

The Bayesian procedures, presented in this work, provide estimates of the
 parameters directly from the observed sample path, without any need for
 fitting or Monte Carlo sampling.
 This is in contrast to, the more commonly used PSD, where additional errors
 are incurred due to the fitting methods.

Thus, we conclude that the Bayesian method can be used for accurate viscometry
 using only the discretely observed sample paths of a trapped Brownian particle.

In this work, we have presented an exact Bayesian method for jointly estimating
 the mean regression rate and the diffusion coefficient of an optically
 trapped Brownian particle.
 The trap stiffness in temperature units is obtained as a ratio of the mean
 regression rate and the diffusion coefficient.
 We have also rephrased the standard

equipartition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method of directly estimating the trap stiffness as a problem in Bayesian
 inference.
 We have assumed that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is the data generating
 model.
 More general models, which include the position dependence of the particle
 friction (as would be the case in the proximity to walls) or the non-Markovian
 character of the trajectories (as would be the case when momentum diffusion
 is not slow compared to the time scales of interest) can, with additional
 effort, be incorporated in the Bayesian framework.
 Exact analytical solutions will no longer be available and one has to resort
 to approximations of the likelihood, such as short-time expansions of the
 Fokker-Planck propagator or numerical solutions of the equivalent stochastic
 differential equations.
 These introduce discretization errors which must be carefully evaluated.
 In contrast, the method presented here is exact and can serve as an useful

Bayesian analysis is generally applicable in studying the dynamics (Brownian
 or otherwise) of a vast range of mesoscopic particles in diverse trapping
 environments.
 The capability of modeling the apparatus itself could also be extremely
 helpful in understanding and improving the experimental techniques employed
 in optical trapping with the possibility of studying different systematic
 effects that may influence the trajectory of trapped particles, thus enhancing
 the capabilities and sphere of influence of optical tweezers.

Bayesian methods for data analysis are not widespread in soft matter, despite
 of their advantages and demonstrated success in other areas of physics.
 To quote a popular textbook

Increasingly, researchers in many branches of science are coming into contact
 with Bayesian statistics or Bayesian probability theory.
 By encompassing both inductive and deductive logic, Bayesian analysis can
 improve model parameter estimates by many orders of magnitude.
 It provides a simple and unified approach to all data analysis problems,
 allowing the experimenter to assign probabilities to competing hypotheses
 of interest, on the basis of the current state of knowledge.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Bayesian viscometry in an optical trap.
 The first column is the viscosity of the solvent as measured in a rheometer
 and the second column is the diffusion coefficient as given by the Stokes-Einst
ein relation for that value of the viscosity.
 The third column is the Bayesian MAP estimate for the diffusion coefficient
 and the fourth column is the value of the viscosity, as given by the Stokes-Ein
stein relation for the corresponding value of the diffusion coefficient.
 There is a good match between the first and fourth columns.
 Note that the first row is for water while the rest are for water + glycerol
 samples with increasing glycerol concentration.

Appendix 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first partial derivatives of the logarithm of the posterior probability
 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\frac{\partial\ln P}{\partial\lambda} & =\frac{N-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{I_{2}^{\prime}}{I_{2}}\right)-\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{2DI_{2}}-\frac{\lambda}{2D}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2\lambda}-\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{2D},\quad\frac{\partial\ln P}{\partial D}=-\frac{N-1}{2D}+\frac{\lambda\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{2D^{2}I_{2}}-\frac{1}{2D}+\frac{\lambda x_{1}^{2}}{2D^{2}},
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}^{\prime}=2\Delta t\thinspace e^{-2\lambda\Delta t}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting the second of these equations to zero, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is solved in term of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and this solution is used in the first equation, together with the large-sample
 asymptotics
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\frac{\lambda}{N}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}+x_{1}^{2}\right) & \thickapprox\frac{\lambda}{\left(N-1\right)}\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}},
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

to cancel all 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dependent terms.
 Setting the resulting equation to zero and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 then yields the MAP estimates in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:map-estimate"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second partial derivatives, appearing in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quadratic-form"

\end_inset

), are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\Sigma_{11}^{-1}=\frac{\partial^{2}\ln P}{\partial\lambda^{2}} & =\frac{N-1}{2}\Big(-\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}+\frac{I_{2}^{\prime}I_{2}^{\prime}}{I_{2}^{2}}-\frac{I_{2}^{\prime\prime}}{I_{2}}\Big)-\frac{1}{2\lambda^{2}}-\frac{1}{D}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}\right)-\frac{\lambda}{2D}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\lambda^{2}}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}\right),\\
\Sigma_{12}^{-1}=\frac{\partial^{2}\ln P}{\partial D\partial\lambda}= & \frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{2D^{2}I_{2}}+\frac{\lambda}{2D^{2}}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}\right)+\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{2D^{2}},\qquad\Sigma_{22}^{-1}=\frac{\partial^{2}\ln P}{\partial D^{2}}=\frac{N-1}{2D^{2}}-\frac{\lambda}{D^{3}}\Big(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}-x_{1}^{2}\Big)+\frac{1}{2D^{2}},
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}^{\prime\prime}=-4\Delta t^{2}\thinspace e^{-2\lambda\Delta t}$
\end_inset

.
 All the derivatives are evaluated at the maximum given in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:map-estimate"

\end_inset

).
 These are assembled into the Hessian matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}$
\end_inset

and the matrix is inverted to give the covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quadratic-form"

\end_inset

), whose matrix elements are 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\lambda}^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\lambda D}^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{D}^{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma_{\lambda}^{2}= &  & -\frac{1}{\det\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}}\Sigma_{22}^{-1},\qquad\sigma_{\lambda D}^{2}=\frac{1}{\det\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}}\Sigma_{12}^{-1},\qquad\sigma_{D}^{2}=-\frac{1}{\det\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}}\Sigma_{11}^{-1},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}=\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}-\Sigma_{12}^{-1}\Sigma_{21}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{21}^{-1}=\Sigma_{12}^{-1}$
