\begin_layout Abstract
Bayesian inference provides a principled way of estimating the parameters
 of a stochastic process that is observed discretely in time.
 The overdamped Brownian motion of a particle confined in an optical trap
 is generally modelled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and can be observed
 directly in experiment.
 Here we present Bayesian methods for inferring the parameters of this process,
 the trap stiffness and the particle friction coefficient, that use exact
 likelihoods and sufficient statistics to arrive at simple expressions for
 the maximum a posteriori estimates.
 This obviates the need for Monte Carlo sampling and yields methods that
 are both fast and accurate.
 We apply these to experimental data and compare with commonly used non-Bayesian
 estimation methods.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the seminal contributions of Rayleigh, Einstein, and Langevin, stochastic
 processes have been used to model physical phenomena in which fluctuations
 play an essential role.
 Examples include the Brownian motion of a particle, the fluctuation of
 current in a resistor, and the radioactive decay of subatomic particles.
 A central problem is to infer the parameters of the process from partially
 observed sample paths, for instance, the diffusion constant from a time
 series of positions, or the resistance from a time series of current measuremen
ts, and so on.
 Bayesian inference provides a principled solution for this inverse problem,
 making optimal use of the information contained in the partially observed
 sample path.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is commonly used to model the sample paths
 of a harmonically confined Brownian particle.
 This process has a mean regression rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and a volatility 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 which map, in the physical application, to the stiffness 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of the harmonic potential, the friction 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the particle and the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

 of the ambient fluid.
 Since the friction of a particle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=6\pi\eta a$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the viscosity of the fluid, any estimation of the friction also provides
 an estimate of the viscosity of the medium, given the particle radius.
 Thus, the viscosity, which is defined as the macroscopic response of the
 fluid to an externally imposed shear, can be inferred from microscopic
 obversation of the Brownian fluctuations of harmonically confined particle.
 Likewise, the particle diffusion coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 can be inferred from the friction through the Einstein relation 
\begin_inset Formula $D=k_{B}T/\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 These, of course, are consequences of the relation between response and
 correlation that prevails in a physical system in thermal equilibrium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we apply Bayesian inference to the problem of estimating
 the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process from time series that
 represent partially observed sample paths.
 This is of great current experimental relevance, since harmonic confinement
 of micron-sized spheres is easily achieved using optical tweezers.
 A reliable estimation of the trap stiffness is a necessary first step in
 using tweezers for force measurements.
 Bayesian methods, using Monte Carlo sampling, have been proposed earlier
 to this end 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "richly2013calibrating"

\end_inset

.
 Here, we present a method that does away with sampling by exploiting the
 exact likelihoods and sufficient statistics of the problem and provides,
 thereby, exact maximum a posteriori parameter estimates in terms of these
 statistics.
 Consequently, the method is both extremely fast and accurate, being able
 to jointly estimate the trap stiffness and the particle friction from a
 time series with a million points in less than a millisecond.
 Further, the fluctuation-dissipation relation provides a stringent internal
 consistency check on the accuracy of the estimation.
 We apply our method to experimental data to find estimates that have excellent
 internal consistency.
 These estimates are found to be in good agreement with commonly used non-Bayesi
an calibration methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
 In the next section we recall several key properties of the sample paths
 and distributions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
 In Section III, we present the Bayesian methods and follow, in section
 IV, with their application to experimental data.
 We conclude with a discussion of future directions in Bayesian inference
 in optical tweezer experiments.

\begin_layout Section
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Langevin equation for a Brownian particle confined in a potential 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m\dot{v}+\gamma v+\nabla U=\xi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(t)$
\end_inset

 is a zero-mean Gaussian white noise with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle\xi(t)\xi(t')\rangle=2k_{B}T\gamma\delta(t-t')$
\end_inset

 as required by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
 In the limit of vanishing inertia and a harmonic potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\frac{{1}}{2}kx^{2}$
\end_inset

, we obtain the overdamped Langevin equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}=-\frac{k}{\gamma}x+\sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{\gamma}}\zeta(t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(t)$
\end_inset

 is now a zero-mean Gaussian white noise with unit variance.
 This is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, whose sample paths obey the Ito
 stochastic differential equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dx=-\lambda xdt+\sigma dW
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the Wiener process, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=k/\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the mean-regression rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sqrt{2k_{B}T\gamma^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 is the volatility.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $D=k_{B}T\gamma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}=2D.$
\end_inset

 In problems involving Brownian motion, it is convenient to work with the
 diffusion coefficient, rather than the volatility, and therefore we infer
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, directly.

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}(a,b)$
\end_inset

 is the univariate normal distribution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and variance 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 This solution is exact and holds for arbitrary values of 
\begin_inset Formula $|t-t^{\prime}|$
\end_inset

, unlike the approximate solution used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which is accurate only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda|t-t^{\prime}|\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 The correlation function decays exponentially, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C(t-t^{\prime})\equiv\langle x(t)x(t^{\prime})\rangle=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}e^{-\lambda|t-t^{\prime}|}
\end{equation}

which is Lorentzian in the angular frequency

The stationary distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(x)$

\begin{equation}
x\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{D}{\lambda}\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{k_{B}T}{k}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Comparing the forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1|1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 it is clear that former tends to the latter for 
\begin_inset Formula $|t-t^{\prime}|\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, as it should.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bayesian inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider, now, the time series 
\begin_inset Formula $X\equiv(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{N})$
\end_inset

 consisting of observations of the sample path 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 at the discrete times 
\begin_inset Formula $t=n\Delta$
\end_inset

t with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,\ldots,N.$
\end_inset

 Then, using the Markov property of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the
 probability of the sample path is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(X|\lambda,D)=\prod_{n=1}^{N-1}P_{1|1}(x_{n+1}|x_{n},\lambda,D)P_{1}(x_{1}|\lambda,D)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\lambda,D|X)$
\end_inset

 of the parameters, given the sample path, can now be computed using Bayes
 theorem, as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\lambda,D|X)=\frac{P(X|\lambda,D)P(\lambda,D)}{P(X)}
\]

\end_inset

The denominator 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X)$
\end_inset

 is an unimportant normalization, independent of the parameters, that we
 henceforth ignore.
 Since both 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 must be positive, for stability and positivity of entropy production respective
ly, we use informative priors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\lambda,D)=H(\lambda)H(D)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the Heaviside step function.
 This assigns zero probability weight for negative values of the parameters
 and equal probability weight for all positive values.
 The logarithm of the posterior probability, after using the explicit forms
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1|1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

, is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\ln P(\lambda,D|X) & =\frac{N-1}{2}\ln\frac{\lambda}{2\pi DI_{2}}-\frac{\lambda}{2DI_{2}}\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}\nonumber \\
 & +\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{\lambda}{2\pi D}-\frac{\lambda}{2D}x_{1}^{2}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where we have defined the two quantities 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I_{2}\equiv1-e^{-2\lambda\Delta t},\quad\Delta_{n}\equiv x_{n+1}-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}x_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and the sum runs from 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,\ldots,N-1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda^{\star},D^{\star})$
\end_inset

 solves the stationary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\ln P(\lambda,D|X)/\partial\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\ln P(\lambda,D|X)/\partial D=0$
\end_inset

, while the standard error of this estimate is obtained from the matrix
 of second derivatives evaluated at the maximum.
 The analytical solution of the stationary conditions, derived in the Appendix,
 yields the MAP estimate to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda^{\star} & = & \frac{1}{\Delta t}\ln\frac{\sum x_{n}^{2}}{\sum x_{n+1}x_{n}}\nonumber \\
D^{\star} & = & \frac{\lambda^{\star}}{N}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}+x_{1}^{2}\right)\nonumber \\
\frac{k^{\star}}{k_{B}T} & = & \frac{\lambda^{\star}}{D^{\star}}\label{eq:map-estimate}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where both 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 are now evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\lambda^{\star}.$
\end_inset

 These provide direct estimates of the parameters without the need for fitting
 or sampling.
 The standard errors of these estimates are obtained from the matrix of
 second derivates of the posterior, evaluated at the maximum.
 We do not provide their unwieldy expressions but do make use of them when
 reporting point estimates from experimental data (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second Bayesian procedure for estimating the trap stiffness alone results
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is interpreted not as a time series but as an exchangeable sequence, or,
 in physical terms, as repeated independent observations of the stationary
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, the posterior probability, assuming an informative prior
 that constrains 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to positive values, is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln P(k|X)=\frac{N}{2}\ln\frac{k}{2\pi k_{B}T}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{k}{k_{B}T}\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_{n}^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The MAP estimate straightforwardly follows,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{k^{\star}}{k_{B}T}=\frac{N}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_{n}^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This procedure is independent of the sampling time and is equivalent to
 the equipartition method when the Heaviside prior is used for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The posterior probabilities in both methods can be written in terms of four
 functions of the data
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
T_{1}(X) & = & \sum x_{n+1}^{2},\quad T_{2}(X)=\sum x_{n+1}x_{n},\nonumber \\
T_{3}(X) & = & \sum x_{n}^{2},\qquad T_{4}(X)=x_{1}^{2},
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

which, therefore, are the sufficient statistics of the problem.
 The 
\emph on
entire
\emph default
 information in the time series 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 relevant to estimation is contained in these four statistics.
 Their use reduces computational expense enormously as only four numbers,
 rather than the entire time series, is required.
 The combined use of exact likelihoods, sufficient statistics and analytical
 MAP estimates yields fast and accurate methods for estimating parameters
 from the time series of particle positions.
 This completes our description of the Bayesian procedure for jointly estimating
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, and from there, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the estimates obtained from these independent procedures
 provides a check on the validity of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a
 data model.
 Any significant disagreement between the estimates from the two methods
 signals a breakdown of applicability of the model and the assumptions implicit
 in it: overdamped dynamics, constant friction, harmonicity of the potential,
 and thermal equilibrium.

 The motion of a single trapped particle is observed by back-focal plane
 interferometry using the back-scattered intensity of a detection laser

\begin_inset Formula $671$
\end_inset

 nm that co-propagates with the trapping laser.
 The detection laser power is maintained at much lower levels than that
 required to trap a particle.
 The back-scattered signal from the trapped particle is measured using a
 balanced detection scheme, schematically illustrated in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The back-scattered light beam is incident on an edge mirror which divides
 it equally into two halves that are focused using two lenses of equal focal
 length on photodiodes PD1 and PD2 (
\emph on
Thorlabs
\emph default
 PDA100A-EC Si-photodiodes of bandwidth 2.4 MHz).
 The voltage outputs 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

, of PD1 and PD2 respectively, are then combined as 
\begin_inset Formula $(A-B)/(A+B)$
\end_inset

 to give the normalized value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 coordinate of motion at any instant of time.
 The advantage of such balanced detection is that the intensity fluctuations
 of the laser are present in both beams simultaneously and are thus canceled
 out when the difference is taken.
 Note that the direction of the edge mirror decides whether the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 coordinate of motion is being measured.
 The mirror is rotated by 
\begin_inset Formula $90$

 degrees to select between the coordinates.
 The fast response of the photodiodes, with a rise time of 50ns at highest
 gain, ensures that spurious correlations are kept to a minimum and the
 data filtering necessary with slower commercial quadrant photodetectors
 is avoided entirely.
 The data from the photodiodes is logged into a computer using a National
 Instruments DAQ system and Labview at sampling rates between 2-5 kHz.

 in the back-focal plane of the microscope objective and scan the trapped
 bead by distances which are determined from the pixel calibration of images
 taken by the camera attached to the microscope

\end_inset

.
 The balanced detection output is simultaneously measured to yield the voltage-d
istance calibration of the detection system.
 For the viscosity measurement, we add glycerol to water in fixed proportions
 to create 5 samples of different viscosity.
 The viscosity of each sample is then measured by a commercial rheometer
 (Brookfield DB3TLVCJ0) to match with the experimental results.

\begin_layout Standard
The results of our measurements of trap stiffness as a function of trapping
 laser power and the viscosity of the glycerol + water solutions are summarized
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, respectively.
 For each data set of the displacement of the single trapped polystyrene
 bead of diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $3\mu$
\end_inset

m (Brownian particle), we first check the quality of raw time series data
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(a)) from the position histogram counts and ensure that it fits well to
 a Gaussian (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(b)).
 We then plot the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density
 (PSD) of the data, and again ensure robust exponential and Lorentzian fits,
 respectively (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(c) and (d)).
 The Bayesian analyses is carried out only for those series of data which
 show good results in the preliminary analyses, and we proceed to calculate
 the MAP estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda^{\star},D^{\star})$
\end_inset

 both analytically and numerically as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(e).
 As is clear from the figure, the results match very well, and the standard
 deviation of the estimated parameters for one set of time series data using
 the Bayesian analysis is less than 0.1%.
 In comparison, the corresponding error in the estimates from the PSD is
 much higher, being typically of the order of 3-4%, which can be mostly
 attributed to the variability of the results on changing the start and
 end points of the Lorentzian fit to the data shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(d).
 Thus, it is clear that the inherent error in the Bayesian estimation is
 far lesser than that in the PSD fit - something which is important to note
 considering that the Lorentzian fit to the PSD is the most standard calibration
 method in optical trapping.
 However, we still use the PSD technique as a benchmark for our estimates
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at different trapping laser powers, which is shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table1"

\end_inset

.
 The trapping stiffness increases linearly with laser power, and we check
 for this by trapping at six different laser powers.
 The measured values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 by the Bayesian MAP and stationary (equipartition) analyses agree very
 well.
 Note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $1\sigma$
\end_inset

 errors indicated in parenthesis are actually the standard errors of the
 mean values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 after averaging over 5 different data sets for each laser power.
 The PSD are also computed for the same 5 sets of data, and a typical averaged
 spectrum is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

(d).
 The variation of trap stiffness with laser power is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"

\end_inset

(f), and we get good linear fits with the slopes of the Bayesian processes
 and the PSD agreeing well within 
\begin_inset Formula $1\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 For the viscosity data, we show the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table2"

\end_inset

, from which the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 are evaluated.
 The agreement with the values measured using the rheometer is good to within
 3% for all data points except for the highest viscosity value, where the
 trap was not very robust due to the high viscosity.
 Note that for all these measurements the trap stiffness was kept constant
 to around 6

 Thus, it is clear that the inherent error in the Bayesian estimation is

 becomes of crucial importance, and we perform fresh calibrations for each

 good to within 3% for all data points except for the highest viscosity

\begin_layout Standard
The partial derivatives of the logarithm of the posterior probability with
 respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial\ln P}{\partial\lambda} & = & \frac{N-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{I_{2}^{\prime}}{I_{2}}\right)-\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{2DI_{2}}\\
 & - & \frac{\lambda}{2D}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2\lambda}-\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{2D}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\ln P}{\partial D}=-\frac{N-1}{2D}+\frac{\lambda\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{2D^{2}I_{2}}-\frac{1}{2D}+\frac{\lambda x_{1}^{2}}{2D^{2}}`
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}^{\prime}=2\Delta t\thinspace e^{-2\lambda\Delta t}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting the second of these equations to zero, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is solved in term of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and this solution is used in the first equation, together with the large-sample
 asymptotics
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\lambda}{N}\left(\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}}+x_{1}^{2}\right)\thickapprox\frac{\lambda}{\left(N-1\right)}\frac{\sum\Delta_{n}^{2}}{I_{2}},
\]

\end_inset

to cancel all 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dependent terms.
 Setting the resulting equation to zero and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 then yields the MAP estimates in Eq.(
