These 4 files are the displacement of the test bead in the presence of the first bead which has been excited by a square wave pulse. 
The first bead moves as an exponential between the two positions. We pick the displacement of the test bead located in a shallow trap in the 
presence of the first bead. The displacement is recorded with a quadrant photodiode and has a unit of Volts which is proportional to the actual 
displacement. Each data set has been averaged over 38 subsequent times the experiment is repeated. Please note that 250 ms of data 
corresponds to two square wave pulses. The phase delay between the initial square wave and this particular response has not been recorded. 

We could record the time constant of the decaying exponential motion of the first bead in a later experiment. We can do a much more elaborate 
experiment about the coupling if you could match these trajectories first. If it doesnt match at all, we know there is a problem with the 
way the experiment has been performed in the first place. 

The distance between the centers of the beads is 4 microns and the diameter is 3 microns. 

The displacements of the first bead are represented in Volts in terms of the amplitude of the square wave that drives the accousto optic modulator.
The separation between the equilibrium spots of the bead is proportional to this voltage.
