\begin_layout Abstract
The temperature variation of the surface tension at a liquid-gas interface
 generates tangential thermocapillary stresses which produce flows in the
 ambient fluid.
 Here, we demonstrate that such active stresses can be produced in a controlled
 manner by inducing a microbubble in optical tweezers.
 Mesoscopic particles dispersed in the ambient fluid self-assemble in preferenti
al ring patterns on on the bubble interface under the action of the resulting
 flow, and may even be released from the interface by modulating the bubble
 diameter controllably.
 We carry out a complete theoretical treatment of the problem based on the
 Navier Stokes and heat equations to calculate the flow profile around the
 bubble in order to explain the self-assembly and release of the particles.
 We experimentally demonstrate capture, release, and transport of a wide
 range of particles ranging from gold nanoparticles to polystyrene microspheres
 using thermophoretic motion of the bubble under translation of the optical
 tweezers.
 Multiple microbubbles allow for additional control on particle self-assembly
 and manipulation, as we demonstrate for a pair of microbubbles.
 Active thermocapillary stress offers a mechanism for trapping and manipulating
 particles that are, otherwise, difficult to trap in optical tweezers.

\begin_layout Standard
The study of active stress on mesoscopic particles in fluidic environments
 has evoked widespread scientific interest in recent times since it enables
 the understanding and ultimate control of fundamental processes involving
 fluid-particle interactions at a microscopic level, and leads to a variety
 of applications.
 The fundamental processes range from transport of organelles inside the
 fluidic environment in a cell [1], to the motion of cilia and flagella
 of swimming bacteria [2].
 The analysis of the active stress involved in many such processes has led
 to the design of

active

 particles [3], that often mimic natural microswimmers.
 These active particles move in pre-designed paths by interacting with their
 environment and exchanging energy by diverse processes including thermophoresis
 [4], electrophoresis [5], diffusiophoresis [6], etc.
 Such controlled motion of mesoscopic particles under different active stress
 has very significant implications in different areas including cell biology
 [7], nanomedicine [8], and micro-patterning [8].
 Active stress can also be induced on microparticles in a fluid by manipulating
 the flow environment using different techniques of actuation [9] in microfluidi
c channels, and by generating surface stresses by controlled modulation
 of fluid-fluid or fluid-solid boundaries.
 The latter can be achieved by a number of processes such as electrowetting
 [10], thermocapillary action [11], and Marangoni stresses [12].
 Recently, the manipulation of polystyrene microspheres [13] and carbon
 nanoparticles [14] has been demonstrated using the thermocapillary stress
 generated due to a micro-bubble which was produced thermally in optical
 tweezers.

\begin_layout Standard
Optical tweezers have the ability to trap and manipulate mesoscopic particles
 by applying controlled forces ranging from fN- to few hundreds of pN.
 They have a few limitations in their applicability - namely: 1) in the
 manipulation or transport of multiple particles over large distances simultaneo
usly, and 2) in the stable and robust trapping of nanoparticles.
 The latter is due to the fact that very small nanoparticles (of a few nm
 in size) are difficult to trap individually since the optical gradient
 force reduces proportionally with the particle volume [15], and also due
 to heating issues which cause metallic nanoparticles to become unstably
 confined in a strong optical trap [16].
 Given this situation, thermophoretic trapping with the aid of laser induced
 microbubbles have proved an excellent solution for both transporting microparti
cles over long distances [13], and in trapping nanoparticles in a stable
 manner without heating effects [14].
 Thermophoretic traps are much stronger than all-optical traps, with the
 trapping force in the range of nN [17], so that the microbubbles thus trapped
 can be manipulated with high speed over large distances [18].
 These bubbles are mostly generated by focusing the trapping laser on an
 absorbing substrate in the trapping chamber (filled generally by water),
 which causes the water in the vicinity of the laser

hot spot
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to vaporize, thus causing a bubble, which is trapped at the hot spot.
 Active Marangoni stress is immediately developed due to the difference
 in temperature on the two poles of the bubble (the higher temperture being
 on the pole in touch with the hot spot), generating convective flow of
 water around the bubble.
 Particles are drawn towards the bubble due to this convective flow and
 attach to the bubble surface [13,14,17].
 The bubble can be manipulated by translating the laser hot spot.

\begin_layout Standard
While such trapping by attaching particles of the air-water interace (bubble
 surface) has been experimentally demonstrated, there exists a considerable
 lacuna in the exact theoretical understanding of the flow pattern of the
 liquid around the bubble.
 In addition, while experiments have demonstrated attachment of particles
 to the bubble surface and the subsequent translation of the bubble with
 the particles, a controllable and consistent method for detaching the particles
 from the bubble surface without destroying the bubble is yet to be shown.
 This renders this otherwise robust particle transportation technique somewhat
 incomplete.
 In this paper, we address both these issues.
 By solving the Navier Stokes and heat equations, we calculate the exact
 flow pattern of liquid around a laser induced microbubble.
 We go on to show how the flow pattern may be modified by having two bubbles
 adjacent to each other, and the implications on particle motion.
 Experimentally, we demonstrate interesting and reproducible self assembly
 of polystyrene beads of different sizes on the bubble surface - a phenomenon
 that is easily explained by our theoretical simulations.
 We also develop a technique for controllable release and attachment of
 particles to a bubble by modulating the bubble size, and proceed to demonstrate
 capture, transport, and release of gold and silver nanoparticles using
 a single microbubble.
 Finally, we provide a glimpse of the fascinating possibilities of manipulating
 the trajectories of micro-particles by trapping two micro-bubbles adjacent
 to each other, and observing particle trajectories in their vicinity.
 We believe that with proper choice of micro-bubble sizes and separations,
 this method can be eventually used as a tunable particle sorter - having
 the capability of sorting particles of different sizes continuously, since
 the bubble sizes and separations can be continuously tuned.
