Package for simulating and estimating position velocity trajectories and estimating mass, trap stiffness and particle friction using Bayesian statistics

Requirements: pyprocess (https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/PyProcess)

edit pymvou.py and edit the path of pyprocess from sys.path.append('/home/dipanjan/PyProcess/pyprocess') to whatever the path of pyprocess is on your computer

runfile.py is all that matters, just set the parameter values and you are good to go!

Open up a terminal
Type the following line

python runfile.py

Enjoy!
